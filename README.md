# Vagrant Grid5000 Provider

<span class="badges">
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-grid5000.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-grid5000)
</span>

This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) plugin that adds a provider for
machines running on the [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr) testbed to
Vagrant.

## Installation and usage

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-grid5000
```

Each provider needs at least one ''box''. This does not really make sense here, so we are providing a dummy one.
```
$ vagrant box add --name dummy https://github.com/lnussbaum/vagrant-grid5000/raw/master/dummy.box
```

Example basic Vagrantfile:
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # Global configuration for Grid'5000
  config.vm.provider "grid5000" do |g5k|
    # Ruby-Cute's authentication parameters
    #g5k.cute_parameters = { :conf_file => "config file path" }
    # For details about allowed parameters see
    # https://github.com/lnussbaum/vagrant-grid5000/blob/master/lib/vagrant-grid5000/config.rb
  end

  config.vm.define :my_g5k_box do |g5k|
    g5k.vm.box = "dummy"
  end
end
```

Then try
```
$ vagrant up --provider=grid5000
$ vagrant ssh
$ vagrant provision
$ vagrant destroy
```

For more details about Vagrantfile configuration parameters, see
https://github.com/lnussbaum/vagrant-grid5000/blob/master/Vagrantfile

### Synced folders

Synced folders are a bit tricky. You need to install 'rsync' (which is not
installed on jessie-x64-min), and then issue a ''vagrant reload'' to reload the
configuration. Note that you can also use 'rsync-auto' to auto-synchronize
changes.

## License

The gem is available as free software under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Development

To work on the `vagrant-grid5000` plugin, clone this repository out, and use
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:

```
$ bundle
```

You can test the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by
using the `Vagrantfile` in the top level of this directory and use bundler to
execute Vagrant.
```
$ bundle exec vagrant up --provider=grid5000
```
etc.

To debug stuff, use vagrant --debug.
